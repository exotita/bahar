# Advanced Linguistic Analysis

## Overview

The **Advanced Analysis** feature provides comprehensive linguistic analysis using four specialized analyzers. This goes beyond basic emotion detection to explore deep linguistic structures, semantics, morphology, and discourse patterns.

## What is Advanced Analysis?

Advanced Analysis combines multiple linguistic analysis techniques to provide insights into:

- **Lexical & Compositional Semantics**: Understanding word meanings and relationships
- **Morphology & Phonology**: Analyzing word structure and sound patterns
- **Distributional Semantics & Embeddings**: Exploring semantic spaces and word relationships
- **Pragmatics & Discourse**: Examining how language is used in context

## Key Features

### ðŸ“š Lexical & Compositional Semantics

**What it analyzes:**
- **Word Sense Disambiguation**: Determining the correct meaning of ambiguous words
- **Semantic Similarity**: Measuring how similar words are in meaning
- **Lexical Chains**: Identifying sequences of semantically related words
- **Polysemy**: Detecting words with multiple meanings

**Metrics provided:**
- Lexical Diversity (0-1): Variety of vocabulary used
- Semantic Density (0-1): Concentration of meaningful content
- Polysemy Rate (0-1): Proportion of words with multiple meanings
- Cohesion Score (0-1): How well the text holds together semantically

**Example insights:**
```
Text: "The bank by the river has steep slopes."
- Word "bank" disambiguated as "riverbank" (not financial institution)
- Lexical chain: bank â†’ river â†’ slopes (geographical features)
- High semantic cohesion due to consistent theme
```

### ðŸ”¤ Morphology & Phonology

**What it analyzes:**
- **Morpheme Segmentation**: Breaking words into meaningful units
- **Affix Detection**: Identifying prefixes, suffixes, and infixes
- **Syllabification**: Dividing words into syllables
- **Phonological Features**: Analyzing sound patterns (consonants, vowels)

**Metrics provided:**
- Morphemes per Word: Average morphological complexity
- Morphological Complexity (0-1): Overall structural complexity
- Syllables per Word: Average syllable count
- Consonant/Vowel Ratio: Phonological balance

**Example insights:**
```
Text: "The researchers are investigating unprecedented phenomena."
- "researchers" â†’ research + er + s (3 morphemes)
- "investigating" â†’ in + vestig + ate + ing (4 morphemes)
- "unprecedented" â†’ un + pre + cedent + ed (4 morphemes)
- High morphological complexity (many affixes)
```

### ðŸ§  Distributional Semantics & Embeddings

**What it analyzes:**
- **Word Embeddings**: 300-dimensional vector representations
- **Semantic Neighbors**: Words with similar meanings
- **Semantic Clustering**: Grouping related concepts
- **Dimensionality Analysis**: Understanding semantic space structure

**Metrics provided:**
- Vector Dimensionality: Number of dimensions (typically 300)
- Semantic Density (0-1): How tightly concepts are related
- Cluster Quality (0-1): How well-defined semantic groups are
- Effective Dimensions: Number of meaningful dimensions

**Example insights:**
```
Text: "Dogs and cats are popular pets. Many families adopt animals."
- Semantic cluster 1: dogs, cats, pets, animals (animals)
- Semantic cluster 2: popular, families, adopt (social)
- "dogs" neighbors: cats (0.85), puppies (0.78), pets (0.72)
- High semantic density (focused topic)
```

### ðŸ’¬ Pragmatics & Discourse

**What it analyzes:**
- **Entity Tracking**: Following mentions of people, places, things
- **Coreference Resolution**: Linking pronouns to their referents
- **Discourse Relations**: Understanding how sentences connect
- **Information Flow**: Tracking given vs. new information

**Metrics provided:**
- Entity Density (0-1): Concentration of named entities
- Average Chain Length: How long entity references persist
- Topic Continuity (0-1): How consistently topics are maintained
- Coherence Score (0-1): Overall text coherence

**Example insights:**
```
Text: "John loves his dog. He walks it every morning."
- Entity: "John" (PERSON)
- Coreference chain: John â†’ He (2 mentions)
- Coreference chain: dog â†’ it (2 mentions)
- High topic continuity (consistent subject)
```

## How to Use

### Step 1: Enable Analyzers

Choose which analyzers to run by checking the boxes:

- âœ… **Lexical & Compositional Semantics** - Word meanings and relationships
- âœ… **Morphology & Phonology** - Word structure and sounds
- âœ… **Distributional Semantics & Embeddings** - Semantic spaces
- âœ… **Pragmatics & Discourse** - Context and coherence

**Tip**: Enable all analyzers for comprehensive analysis, or select specific ones for focused insights.

### Step 2: Configure Parameters

**Language**: Select English or Dutch
- English: Uses `en_core_web_lg` spaCy model
- Dutch: Uses `nl_core_news_lg` spaCy model

**Semantic Neighbors (k)**: Number of similar words to find (3-10)
- Lower values: Only closest neighbors
- Higher values: Broader semantic context

**Semantic Clusters**: Number of concept groups (2-5)
- Fewer clusters: Broader categories
- More clusters: Finer distinctions

### Step 3: Enter Text

Paste or type your text in the input area. Works best with:
- **Minimum**: 2-3 sentences (20+ words)
- **Optimal**: 1-2 paragraphs (50-200 words)
- **Maximum**: Several paragraphs (500+ words)

**Note**: Longer texts provide richer analysis but take more time.

### Step 4: Analyze

Click **"ðŸ”¬ Perform Advanced Analysis"** and wait for results.

**Performance**:
