### 📊 Linguistic Dimensions

Linguistic analysis examines how text is written beyond just what emotions it expresses. This provides deeper insights into communication style, formality, tone, and intensity.

---

## Overview

The linguistic analyzer evaluates four key dimensions:

1. **Formality** - How formal or casual the language is
2. **Tone** - The attitude or manner of expression
3. **Intensity** - The strength of emotional expression
4. **Communication Style** - How directly or assertively ideas are expressed

Each dimension is scored with a confidence level (0-100%) indicating how strongly the characteristic is present.
